# A Bread Bakerâ€™s Notebook

This repository houses the development of a simple, web-based interface to browse the bread formulas I am continually developing. The formulas reside in a separate [repo](https://github.com/dananjohnson/bread-formulas) which is linked as a submodule.

## Road map

* Create a simple timeline module for improved readability of recipe method.
* Build out tag functionality.
* Include ingredients in search index.
* Formulas: log overall formula (or generate on website).
