<h1>A Bread Baker’s Notebook</h1>

<p>Like probably most home bakers, I have a notebook filled with the bread formulas I’ve developed, tested, forgotten about, and preserved. As much as I love handwritten recipes, I became frustrated trying to track down an old formula, or adequately tracking how a formula evolved over time. I know others use spreadsheets for these reasons. I hate spreadsheets.</p>

<p>I began thinking about the potential of Git version control and a simple data format like YAML to create a durable, readable, living repository for my formulas. Ultimately, my goal is to create a simple, web-based interface to browse the formulas. But my hope is that the plain-text files for individual formulas can stand on their own as clear guidelines for baking bread.</p>
