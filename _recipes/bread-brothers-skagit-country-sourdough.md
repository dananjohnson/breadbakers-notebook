# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'Decrease levain development time—16 hours was too long due to higher hydration and 100% whole grain flour.'
  - 'Dough shows excellent strength and elasticity even at 93% hydration.'
  - 'Dough was over-developed at shaping time. Reduce bulk to 4–4.5 hours.'
  - 'Beautiful dark crust with a very moist, tender crumb. Fairly mild, slightly sour flavor. Limited oven spring and not as open as possible due to over-proofing. But a great start!'
