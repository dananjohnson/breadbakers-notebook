# Overview
title: Brown Rice & Sesame Bread
excerpt: 'This formula was inspired by the simple but delicious Japanese dish of short-grain brown rice (<em>genmai</em>) served with toasted sesame seeds and salt (<em>goma-shio</em>). Here, those flavors are incorporated into a hearth loaf with lots of pre-fermented whole wheat flour for an even greater depth of flavor. The formula is based on “Brown Rice Bread” from Hamelman’s <em>Bread</em>.'

# Method
method:
  - day: 1
    steps:
      - time: '23:00'
        instr: 'Prepare levain. Rest 16 hours.'
  - day: 2
    steps:
      - time: '14:45'
        instr: 'Autolyse flours and water #1.'
      - time: '15:00'
        instr: 'Toast uncooked brown rice, followed by sesame seeds. Then, in boiling water, cook rice for 15 minutes. Off heat, let rice sit for 10 minutes, then drain and cool.'
      - time: '16:15'
        instr: 'Add levain and salt to autolyse. Slap-and-fold for 5 minutes. Dough will still feel shaggy, but levain should be full incorporated.'
      - time: '16:25'
        instr: 'Begin bulk fermentation.'
      - time: '17:00'
        instr: 'Fold.'
      - time: '17:30'
        instr: 'Add cooked rice and sesame seeds. Fold and pinch to incorporate.'
      - time: '18:30'
        instr: 'Fold.'
      - time: '19:30'
        instr: 'Fold.'
      - time: '20:45'
        instr: 'Shape dough into three boules or batards, and place into floured, lined baskets. Begin ambient proof.'
      - time: '21:00'
        instr: 'Place dutch oven into oven and preheat to 500°F.'
      - time: '22:00'
        instr: 'Tilt first basket to drop bread into dutch oven. Score bread and place in oven.'
      - time: '22:15'
        instr: 'Reduce oven temperature to 460°F.'
      - time: '22:20'
        instr: 'Remove lid from dutch oven.'
      - time: '22:27'
        instr: 'Remove bread from oven. Rest on cooling rack for at least two hours.'

# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'It’s very tricky to incorporate this much stiff levain into a dough with hand-mixing.'
  - 'So much rice and seeds to incorporate. Required lots of pinching, after which the dough did not exhibit a significant amount of rise. Did I degas it?'
  - 'A large percentage of preferment, and thus shorter bulk and proof, and not an ideal combination with having only one combo cooker. The first loaf had only a one-hour proof, the third was 2.5 hours.'
  - 'Hardly any oven spring on any of the loaves. So dense and chewy!'
  - 'This one’s got a long way to go, but it’s worth it because of the amazing flavor. Consider a much smaller preferment and higher hydration to build more open loaves and have more control over proof time.'
