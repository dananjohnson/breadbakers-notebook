# Overview
title: Cranberry, Walnut, & Buckwheat Levain
desc: 'A mildly sweet, nutty autumn or winter bread with a hint of buckwheat. This formula utilizes both a stiff rye levain and a liquid 100% whole wheat levain for increased complexity. Soaked cranberries, with the soaking liquid incorporated, also increases flavor, while also preventing burning in the berries.'

# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'Bulk really picked up the pace; the dough was extremely proof-y by the time of shaping. Decrease proof time (3–3.5 hours?) to accommodate higher levain percentage and sugars from berries.'
  - 'Even with only one-hour proof, dough was overproofed when put into oven. Mild pooling, limited oven spring.'
  - 'Bread retained lots of moisture when cooled.'
  - 'Excellent flavor. Mild buckwheat accent. Next time do cranberry soaker sooner and incorporate more of liquid.'
