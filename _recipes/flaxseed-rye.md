# Overview
title: Flaxseed Rye
excerpt: 'A nutty, hearty half-rye, half-wheat loaf based on Jeffrey Hamelman’s “Flaxseed Rye with an Old Bread Soaker.” Dense but light, this recipe uses a lot of rye, but the flavor has such balance between wheat, rye, and seeds that it tastes not of any one of its parts themselves.'

# Notes
notes:
  - 'Not possible to do an autolyse on this one given how much liquid is used in the soaker, and how high the levain percentage is. Unfortunate though, because this isn’t super easy to mix. Consider increasing the hydration; it could handle a bit more.'
  - 'Don’t expect a custardy, open crumb on this loaf. It’s soft, but dense, due to the percentage of rye.'
  - 'Good oven spring and ear. I think the proof could go a bit longer, but be careful. This one develops fast with all that levain.'
  - 'Phenomenal flavor! Very complex, deep, just slightly sour. The seeds on top add additional great flavor.'
