# Overview
title: Hundo/Hundo Whole Wheat Sourdough
excerpt: "A bread formula for the romantic (or OCD sufferer): 100% whole-grain Yecora Rojo. 100% water. Salt. Nothing more. This formula uses a stiff levain to build strength before the addition of so much water. We also sift a portion of the bran—reincorporating it later as a soaker—to prevent tearing in the dough."

# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'This dough surprises with how fast it develops, due to the whole grain flour. Every step should be done earlier than expected. 12 hours may even be too long for the overnight retard.'
  - 'Don’t be deterred by how wet this dough feels when it’s first mixed. Yecora Rojo is a very high-protein flour, and will surprise you with its strength.'
  - 'Try starting the bran soaker the night before, then fermenting to induce further breakdown of bran.'
