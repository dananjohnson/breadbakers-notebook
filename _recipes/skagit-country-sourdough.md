# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'Dough incorporated easily and developed a smooth, elastic consistency quickly.'
  - 'Through bulk, dough retained great elasticity. Not super strong, but seemed fined.'
  - 'After retard, dough didn’t have a whole lot of lift.'
  - 'The batard looked like swiss cheese after baking—huge holes! What went wrong? Not enough strength built up through mixing? Overproofed? Loaf didn’t have a ton of lift but some.'
  - 'Beautiful golden-brown color on the crust with lots of little bubbles.'
  - 'Other than holes, crumb was super tender. Good, mild wheat flavor; could be a bit more sour and salty.'
