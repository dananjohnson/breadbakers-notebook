# Notes
notes:
  - 'Very difficult to incorporate all the seeds and water into a dough that starts out so stiff. Also seems to keep the dough from rising much during bulk. Next time, maybe use less water in the soaker and more in the mix.'
  - 'Dough is very sticky during shaping, probably due to the flax.'
  - 'Even so, a nice proof and then great spring in the oven.'
