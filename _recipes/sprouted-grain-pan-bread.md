  - day: 2
    steps:
      - time: '11:00'
        instr: 'Rinse the soaked grains in a strainer, drain, and return to bowl. Cover bowl with cheesecloth or a kitchen towel. Repeat this every 12 hours until grains have begun to sprout.'
  - day: 3
    steps:
      - time: '23:00'
        instr: 'Prepare levain. Rest 16 hours.'
  - day: 4
    steps:
      - time: '11:30'
        instr: 'Autolyse flours and liquid ingredients. Use warm water if bringing beer and buttermilk out of refrigerator.'
      - time: '12:00'
        instr: 'Add levain. Mix until well incorporated.'
      - time: '12:30'

      - time: '14:45'
        instr: 'Fold.'
      - time: '16:15'
        instr: 'With wet hands, scoop dough and place into buttered, flour-lined bread pans. Use additional water to smooth the tops of the loaves with your hands. Begin ambient proof.'
      - time: '18:30'
        instr: 'Preheat oven to 425°F.'
      - time: '19:15'
        instr: 'Brush loaves with water and score. Loosely cover with greased foil and put in oven. (Smaller pans can be held out for 15 minutes.)'

        instr: 'Remove from oven and set on cooling rack. Let set overnight before cutting loaves open.'

# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'Due to high absorption of these flours, and/or adding rye chops, I added 25g extra water during bulk. The dough was less wet than previous times making a similar recipe.'
  - 'In pans, the loaves lifted nicely during ambient proof. No further rise in oven, and loaves were very dense. (I mean, they’re always dense, but even more than usual.) Overproofed? Maybe. On the other hand, the Tartine recipe calls for a two-hour ambient proof and then an overnight retard. Perhaps don’t add an extra hour to bulk next time.'
  - 'Additional baking of the loaves after removing them from the pans helped brown up the newly-exposed crust and give a bit of additional flavor, color, and crunch. Still very moist in the interior.'
  - 'Awesome flavor! Toasting the sesame and sunflower seeds, then grinding them a bit, added even more flavor. An overnight retard would probably makes this taste even better.'
