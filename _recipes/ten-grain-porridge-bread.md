# Overview
title: Ten-Grain Porridge Bread
desc: 'I found some old cooked cereal in my fridge, and so I developed this formula to use it up, along with a couple spare bags of flour I found at the back of the pantry. Not bad for a “kitchen sink” recipe. A large amount of cooked, fermented porridge (31.3%) gives this bread a tender, creamy crumb. Einkorn flour also adds a touch of sweetness.'

# Notes
notes:
  - 'Was concerned about using such a wet porridge, but I kept the dough pretty stiff beforehand so as not to over-hydrate. The wetness actually made the porridge much easier to incorporate, and while the dough did become a bit wet and sticky, it remained strong and sprung up nicely in the oven.'
  - 'Probably was wise to use some low-gluten flour like the Einkorn to keep the dough extensible.'
  - 'Wonderful golden texture on the crust. From the Einkorn? Or porridge?'
