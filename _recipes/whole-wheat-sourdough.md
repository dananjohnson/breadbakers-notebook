# Overview
title: Whole-Wheat Sourdough
excerpt: 'A 50/50 blend of 100% whole-grain Yecora Rojo and T85 Skagit 1109 creates a loaf akin to something 100% whole-wheat, but just a bit lighter and with the excellent flavor of 1109. This recipe is definitely a work-in-progress; see the notes at the bottom.'

# Baking notes
notes:
  - 'Dough showed lots of strength anytime I folded, despite this hydration level. Shaping was also pretty strong, though the dough felt sticky.'
  - 'I forgot to incorporate the bran until 3 hours into bulk, which kept it from getting very well incorporated. It also introduced a lot of extra water late in the game, making pre-shape and shaping trickier.'
  - 'Dough stuck badly to the towel. (Use rice flour next time, and maybe some of the bran!)'
  - 'Dough pooled into pans due to sticking. I also think I over-proofed these, since they felt pretty strong during shaping. The dough tasted pretty sour.'
  - 'Beautiful dark brown color with this long of a bake. Very rich whole-wheat flavor, but a bit dense. Consider decreasing hydration, 100% WW flour percentage, or proof, or all of the above.'
